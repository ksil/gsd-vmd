# HOOMD-blue GSD plugin for VMD

Provides a VMD molfile plugin reader for GSD files generated by HOOMD-blue.
In order to compile the plugin, you will first need a working installation
of VMD. Then, installation can be as simple as

```bash
cd /path/to/gsd-vmd
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

On Linux, gsd-vmd should automatically detect the location of your VMD
installation, provided that it is on your path. On OS X, the VMD
installation can be trickier to find. You can hint the location
of your VMD plugin directory by setting `VMDDIR` either as an
environment variable or as a build-time definition. Failing this,
you can also force the values of your plugin installation directory
and plugin include directory with the `VMD_PLUGIN_INCLUDE_PATH`
and `VMD_PLUGIN_MOLFILE_PATH`. These directories are the location
of your plugin headers (e.g., `molfile_plugin.h`) and 
system-specific molfile libraries, respectively.

By default, gsd-vmd will be installed into `VMD_PLUGIN_MOLFILE_PATH`.
You can specify an alternative installation location; however, you
must ensure that this is added to your VMD search path, which is a
tricky endeavour and not recommended. To uninstall the library, simply
remove `gsdplugin.so` from the installation location.

This plugin has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and Mac OS X (10.9.5)
using gcc and clang compilers for x86 architecture. No support has been
tested for Windows or other architectures. Both 32-bit and 64-bit
support is enabled on OS X because, although most modern Mac machines
now support 64-bit processing, the binary shipped with VMD is 32-bit,
which could result in incompatibilities.

To test your build (on Linux or OS X), run

```bash
make test
```

out of your build directory. If you have valgrind installed, a memcheck
will also be run to detect memory leaks.

## Requirements
* A compiler supporting basic C99 standard (tested gcc and clang)
* CMake >= 3.1
* valgrind (optional, for testing only)
